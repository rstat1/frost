"Ok so plan" part 1:
    1. Single API URL.
        |
        -> Which means: "https://api.m.rdro.us/{api-name}/method?params"
            |
            -> Which will get proxied to: "http://localhost:port/api/{api-name}/method?params"

    2. Single service for hosting UI -> because it makes zero sense to duplicate the same 3 or 4 lines of code N times
       (one for each service)

    3. https://api.m.rdro.us/volt/ -> watchdog base api URL.

"Ok so plan" part 2:
    1. Single Auth service -> because it makes zero sense to have N different auth services (one for each service)
        |
        -> http://auth.m.rdro.us --- APIName: trinity
        |
        -> Permission controls: Which account can access which service.
    2. Service Instances
        |
        -> Which means production and development versions.
            |
            -> So: "https://api-dev.m.rdro.us/{api-name}/method?params
                |
                -> Which proxies to a secondary instance of the named service
            |
            -> Or: "https://auth-dev.m.rdro.us/whatever
